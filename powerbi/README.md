# Power BI Handoff

This folder contains assets for the BI layer of the tactical analytics workflow.

## Expected Inputs

Use CSV tables generated by:

```bash
python scripts/run_analysis.py --config config/analysis_config.yaml
```

Default output location:

- `outputs/tables/match_summary_scaffold.csv`

## Suggested Model

- Import exported tables from `outputs/tables/`.
- Create dimensions for teams, matches, and competition/season where needed.
- Build tactical pages around possession, chance creation, defensive behavior, and transitions.

## Notes

- This repository does not ship a prebuilt `.pbix` file.
- Keep metric definitions aligned with Python feature engineering logic in `src/features/tactical_metrics.py`.
